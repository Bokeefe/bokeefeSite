  <p>My hobbies and work goals are centered around the various ways that we can use the web to bring people together.  I believe that by focusing on solid web technologies people can lessen their ecological footprint, require less bureaucracy, connect with similar minds, and collaborate more. I have been into hacking in Macintosh's ResEdit, creating my own fonts, and playing around in Photoshop since I was a kid. Other curiosities have lead me to work in sustainable agriculture, convert diesel engine cars to run on recycled veggie oil, produce music in Ableton, 3D animation in Autodesk Maya, and most recently I used the web audio API to make an interactive story/music platform in the browser.<br><br>
  My tendency to "look under the hood" as a maintenance worker for a large university and for a mid-sized company has new exciting avenues in the world of web technology. I hope to find a workplace where I can contribute my work ethic, inquisitive spirit, and problem solving skills to an exciting and collaborative team.<br><br>
  <p>I have several projects for freelance clients that I am currently working on in both the frontend and backend. Please get in touch if you have a web site/app/idea that you want to bring to a reality.</p>

        <li>This is a new startup from a lead developer at a large Boulder tech company. Our stack is mostly React native apps or Wordpress sites depending on the client. My role has been to take on all of the Wordpress work, working in-person with clients to organize their needs, create tickets of work to be done, and execute their site. I also am in an apprenticeship position under the React.js developer so that I can take on that work next month.</li>
      </ul>
      

      <ul>ProgressNow Colorado
        <li>I was brought in to help this non-profit in developing a mobile app for Android and iPhone.  Because it needs to remain editable to non-coders, the app is built in Wordpress and 'wrapped' for mobile devices. My role has been to set up a mySQL database for user information and connect that information to GoogleCivic, OpenStates, and other APIs. The app will use location data to inform user's of their elected representatives as well as schedule push notifications for events and elections relevant to them. This project has also called on me to build custom plugins, a custom theme, and many custom functions that interact with the database. Daily, I write PHP and mySQL in our custom theme keeping in mind best practices relevant to Wordpress.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>Freelance Web Development
        <li>Since graduating I have completed several projects for freelance clients and have an on-going role with these sites and as hosting manager. Many of these sites have been Wordpress sites that use eCommerce for the client to run themselves. I worked with a new startup to build a user-data tracking statistical database in MondoDB. Most recently, I built a platform for managing large groups that are traveling together for conferences or other destinations. This event management site displays relevant information about the trip, itinerary, and also takes in preferences from all those attending and posts these to a Google Sheet for the event planner. Each aspect of the site can be maintained by the event planner without working in code.Similarly, I built a site for a large family reunion where family members sign up for the event and begin a payment planned to share the cost of the event. In my free time, I also recently built a  real-time voting app that utilizes Socket.io as well as an audio platform for musicians (Both are described further below). </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>CodeCraft School of Technology
        <li>During this intensive 10 week course I learned how to program all aspects of web technologies. Starting with a  basis in HTML, CSS, and Javascript, we learned the more specialized uses of Bootstrap, JQuery, Node, Express and Mongoose. Aside from creating professional and exciting websites, we also set up databases that could take user logins, product inventories or perform other backend functions. Lastly, we learned the powerful Angular 2 framework built by Google that uses Typescript. I was on a group project team used Agile management to build a web application which used psychological research on learning to take in data on users and propose hints and reminders to keep the user in their best work-flow. In my final project, I built an engaging browser platform for multiple people to record a song, story, or mixtape over the web. This project utilized the Web Audio API, native Javascript, Express, Mongoose and has a MongoDB database.<a href="https://youtu.be/KDwkkep8ER4"> Final Project Demo</a></li>

      <ul>Assurance Property Management
        <li>I was trusted to work independently to resolve tenant and maintenance issues amongst 150 private units.  The company was transitioning from outsourcing property work and I was motivated to learn new skills that expanded my role with them as well as offset thousands of dollars for the company.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>Iowa City Community School District
        <li>As a substitute teacher, I served primarily as a resource for the various computer and IT courses between two large High Schools and three Junior Highs. Over time, I taught nearly every other subject as I developed great relationships with students and teachers.</li>

        <li> Worked on an excavation that found stone tools (lithics) dating to 800 AD.</li>
        <li>I trained to use electronic X-Ray Fluorescence machine which detected chemical makeup of specimens.</li>
        <li> I then independently developed a method in Excel to take XRF data and point toward a known quarry location where the stone tool would have been quarried. I published on my method as second author under the department chair Dr. James Enloe.</li>

        <p>Show of Hands is a simple browser app that connects all of the users currently on it in real time. Intended for making decisions at large meetings, it has been designed for utter simplicity whether it is being used on a mobile device, tablet, or laptop.  Each person gets to cast one "yea or nay" vote and then the vote count and number of voters is updated in realtime up top.  When all of the people connected have voted, the stats can be named and stored in the database for reference. <br><br>

        <p>I was contracted by a corporate event planner to make a platform for organizing group trips.  The site needed to take in employees, inform them of their itinerary, hotel and flight info, aas well as different choices in activities that they could make. It also sends them to a form where they decide on their trip details. The answers were recorded in a spreadsheet for the event planner. Using a custom built Wordpress theme, I created admin dashboard pages so that the event planner could run the all of the site's management and Google Drive documents without knowing code.<br> <a href="http://meetingsplusportal.com" target="_blank">meetingsplusportal.com</a><br><br>

        <p>Exquisite Warps has been an idea of mine for a long time. It seeks to create a platform for music and storytelling collaboration with friends or strangers.

        Current was built by Charlotte Taylor, Adam Belliveau, Nate Farnsworth, Brendan O'Keefe. It utilizes Javascript, Node, MongoDB, and HighCharts.js.
        <br>
        The theme of the hackathon was to create an educational tool in the browser. Current's goal was to meter people as they spend the day working on a project and use research on learning to help them improve thier efficiency. Users self-report when the eat, take breaks, have coffee, and Current takes that data in. When there is enough data, the user sees a chart of when they were in their most productive work-flow and the circumstances that lead up to it.<br><a href='http://squigpig.herokuapp.com'>LINK</a></p>Javascript, Mongoose, MongoDB, Express, Node
