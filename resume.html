  <p>My hobbies and work goals are centered around the various ways that we can use the web to bring people together.  I believe that by focusing on solid web technologies people can lessen their ecological footprint, require less bureaucracy, connect with similar minds, and collaborate more. I have been into hacking in Macintosh's ResEdit, creating my own fonts, and playing around in Photoshop since I was a kid. Other curiosities have lead me to work in sustainable agriculture, convert diesel engine cars to run on recycled veggie oil, produce music in Ableton, 3D animation in Autodesk Maya, and most recently I used the web audio API to make an interactive story/music platform in the browser.<br><br>
  My tendency to "look under the hood" as a maintenance worker for a large university and for a mid-sized company has new exciting avenues in the world of web technology. I hope to find a workplace where I can contribute my work ethic, inquisitive spirit, and problem solving skills to an exciting and collaborative team.<br><br>
  <p>I have several projects for freelance clients that I am currently working on in both the frontend and backend. Please get in touch if you have a web site/app/idea that you want to bring to a reality.</p>

      <ul>CodeCraft School of Technology
        <li>During this intensive 10 week course I learned how to program all aspects of web technologies. Starting with a  basis in HTML, CSS, and Javascript, we learned the more specialized uses of Bootstrap, JQuery, Node, Express and Mongoose. Aside from creating professional and exciting websites, we also set up databases that could take user logins, product inventories or perform other backend functions. Lastly, we learned the powerful Angular 2 framework built by Google that uses Typescript. I was on a group project team used Agile management to build a web application which used psychological research on learning to take in data on users and propose hints and reminders to keep the user in their best work-flow. In my final project, I built an engaging browser platform for multiple people to record a song, story, or mixtape over the web. This project utilized the Web Audio API, native Javascript, Express, Mongoose and has a MongoDB database.<a href="https://youtu.be/KDwkkep8ER4"> Final Project Demo</a></li>

      <ul>Assurance Property Management
        <li>I was trusted to work independently to resolve tenant and maintenance issues amongst 150 private units.  The company was transitioning from outsourcing property work and I was motivated to learn new skills that expanded my role with them as well as offset thousands of dollars for the company.</li>

      <ul>Iowa City Community School District
        <li>As a substitute teacher, I served primarily as a resource for the various computer and IT courses between two large High Schools and three Junior Highs. Over time, I taught nearly every other subject as I developed great relationships with students and teachers.</li>

        <li> Worked on an excavation that found stone tools (lithics) dating to 800 AD.</li>
        <li>I trained to use electronic X-Ray Fluorescence machine which detected chemical makeup of specimens.</li>
        <li> I then independently developed a method in Excel to take XRF data and point toward a known quarry location where the stone tool would have been quarried. I published on my method as second author under the department chair Dr. James Enloe.</li>

        <p>Exquisite Warps has been an idea of mine for a long time. It seeks to create a platform for music and storytelling collaboration with friends or strangers. Like the artist's game <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exquisite_corpse'>Exquisite Corpse</a>, it uses mystery, imagination, and collaboration to create something big together.<br>

        <p>A MEN stack app made by four developers in a four-day hackathon.<br>
        <br>
        Current was built by Charlotte Taylor, Adam Belliveau, Nate Farnsworth, Brendan O'Keefe. It utilizes Javascript, Node, MongoDB, and HighCharts.js.
        <br>
        The theme of the hackathon was to create an educational tool in the browser. Current's goal was to meter people as they spend the day working on a project and use research on learning to help them improve thier efficiency. Users self-report when the eat, take breaks, have coffee, and Current takes that data in. When there is enough data, the user sees a chart of when they were in their most productive work-flow and the circumstances that lead up to it.<br><a href='http://squigpig.herokuapp.com'>LINK</a></p>
