			<ul>CodeCraft School of Technology
				<li>During this intensive 10 week course I learned how to program all aspects of web technologies. Starting with a  basis in HTML, CSS, and Javascript, we learned the more specialized uses of Bootstrap, JQuery, Node, Express and Mongoose. Aside from creating professional and exciting websites, we also set up databases that could take user logins, product inventories or perform other backend functions. Lastly, we learned the powerful Angular 2 framework built by Google that uses Typescript. I was on a group project team used Agile management to build a web application which used psychological research on learning to take in data on users and propose hints and reminders to keep the user in their best work-flow. In my final project, I built an engaging browser platform for multiple people to record a song, story, or mixtape over the web. This project utilized the Web Audio API, native Javascript, Express, Mongoose and has a MongoDB database.<a href="https://youtu.be/KDwkkep8ER4"> Final Project Demo</a></li>
			</ul>
			<ul>Assurance Property Management
				<li>I was trusted to work independently to resolve tenant and maintenance issues amongst 150 private units.  The company was transitioning from outsourcing property work and I was motivated to learn new skills that expanded my role with them as well as offset thousands of dollars for the company.</li>
			</ul>
			<ul>Iowa City Community School District
				<li>As a substitute teacher, I served primarily as a resource for the various computer and IT courses between two large High Schools and three Junior Highs. Over time, I taught nearly every other subject as I developed great relationships with students and teachers.</li>
			</ul>
			<ul>Louis Berger Group
				<li>Assisting in the testing, digging, and surveying of potential cultural sites around Iowa.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<ul> University of Iowa Anthropology Lab
				<li> Worked on an excavation that found stone tools (lithics) dating to 800 AD.</li>
				<li>I trained to use electronic X-Ray Fluorescence machine which detected chemical makeup of specimens.</li>
				<li> I then independently developed a method in Excel to take XRF data and point toward a known quarry location where the stone tool would have been quarried. I published on my method as second author under the department chair Dr. James Enloe.</li>

					<ul>Iowa City Winter Shelter Cot Campaign
						<li>While volunteering at the shelter I saw they were short on cots and underfunded. I used social media to facilitate awareness and money, secured a discount from a camping supply store and within two days purchased enough cots for the rest of the winter. <a href="http://littlevillagemag.com/iowa-city-musician-raises-money-and-awareness-for-homeless-shelter/"> Link to Article</href></a></li>
